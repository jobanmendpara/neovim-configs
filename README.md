# MelloVim
MelloVim is my personal development environment (heard it from TJ DeVries and I just really dig it). My goal is to create a VS Code clone but to make it more "me".

## What is "me"?
* easy motions
* which-key
* spacebar driven workflows

## Plugins
* Plugin Manager
  * Packer
* Core
  * File explorer with Nvim-Tree
  * Autocompletion with Cmp
  * Git integration with Gitsigns
  * Statusline with lualine
  * Terminal with ToggleTerm
  * Fuzzy finding with Telescope
  * Syntax highlighting with Treesitter
  * Formatting and linting with Null-ls
  * Language Server Protocol with Native LSP
